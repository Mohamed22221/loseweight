    Fresh, whole fruits, as well as blended green smoothies not only
     provide a healthy way for diabetics to get more fruits and vegetables in their diet, green smoothies also may help reverse some of the diet and lifestyle problems that exacerbate diabetes, or contributes to its progression. The great thing about the Smoothie Diet is that it kicks off a chain-reaction of lifestyle changes that reduce or eliminate the factors that exacerbate the disease, and reverses the condition in some individuals. Please note that while I am a nutrition expert, I am not a doctor. If you have diabetes or ANY other health condition, you should always consults 
     with your doctor first before making any dietary changes.
